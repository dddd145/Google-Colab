**概要**\n","\n","このプログラムは、テキストのみでハクスラを遊べるようにしたプログラムです。敵は倒すごとに強くなり、落とすお金も増えます。戦闘終了後、ショップでお金を消費し、回復薬や装備ガチャを回せます。無限に続きます。\n","\n","## **操作方法**\n","\n","`input()`で入力を求めるので、文章の指示に従い操作します。\n","\n","## **制作者のコメント**\n","\n","現在学習済みの知識を生かしてゲームを作ってみました。簡単なコードでのみ制作しました。コード自体は難しくなく、武器の強さと敵の強さのバランスが難しかったです。まだまだ基礎的な知識しか持ち合わせていないので、これからの学習を通して良い作品を制作できるように精進します。\n","\n","##
